These functions are used to compute the maximum Nash welfare allocation for a given valuation matrix.
The maximum Nash welfare allocation is the allocation that maximizes the product of utilities for all agents.

The maximum Nash welfare allocation is EF1 and PO, as was proven in

def maximize_nash_welfare_milp(n, m, valuation_matrix):
    """
    This function maximizes the Nash social welfare given a set of agents and items.
    
    Parameters:
    - n: The number of agents.
    - m: The number of items.
    - valuation_matrix: A matrix of size n x m where valuation_matrix[i, j] represents
                        the valuation of agent i for item j.
    
    The function returns an allocation matrix of size n x m where allocation[i, j] is 1
    if item j is allocated to agent i, and 0 otherwise. The objective is to maximize 
    the sum of the logarithms of the utilities (Nash social welfare) while ensuring 
    each item is allocated to exactly one agent.
    
    The function employs a piecewise linear approximation to the log function to handle 
    the non-linearity while ensuring that the optimization problem remains tractable 
    as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). The approximation uses segments connecting 
    points (k, log(k)) and (k+1, log(k+1)) for k in [1, 999] to tightly bound the log 
    function at each integer point.
